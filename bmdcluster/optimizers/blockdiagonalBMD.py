"""
This module contains a variant of the Binary Matrix Decomposition (BMD) algorithm for clustering binary data
as presented in "A General Model for Clustering Binary Data" (Tao Li, 2005) and "On Clustering Binary Data"
(Tao Li & Shenghuo Zhu, 2005). This varient of the BMD algorithm is for data whose matrix is can be 
rearranged into block-diagonal form. That is, each set of data is associated with a set of features and vice-versa. 
This module implements Algorithm 2 from Li (2005) supplemented with ideas from Li & Zhu (2005). 


General Nomenclature:

 K: the number of data clusters
 C: the number of feature clusters
 n: size of data set
 m: number of data features
 W: binary data matrix
    Is of size n x m, with data in rows and features in columns. 
 A: data cluster indicator matrix
    n x K binary indicator matrix encoding the cluster membership of the data. 
    Each point can belong to exactly one cluster, so each row consists of zeros except for a single 1. 
 B: feature cluster indicator matrix. 
    m x C binary indicator matrix encoding the cluster membership of the features. 
    Each feature can belong to exactly one cluster, so each row consists of zeros except for a single 1.  
 X: a K x C matrix that encodes the relationship between data clusters and feature clusters.
